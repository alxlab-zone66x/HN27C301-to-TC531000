# HN27C301 to TC53100

This is a DIP non-JEDEC 1M (128Kx8) EPROM to TC531000 MROM adapter. This can be used in various systems like a Macintosh SE or Apple IIGS that uses the TC531000 for it's ROM. 

Here's a list of non-JEDEC 1M (128Kx8) EPROMs that will work with this adapter:

- AMD 27C100
- Fujitsu MBM27C1000
- Hitachi HN27C301
- Intel 27C100
- Macronix MX27C1001
- NEC D27C1000
- Sony CXK27C100
- ST M27C1000
- ST ST27C1000
- Toshiba TC571001



## Instructions

After programming your EPROM, solder this adapter to the underside of the chip and bridge the four solder jumpers. 

If you need to reprogram the EPROM you need to desolder the jumpers.

The jumper side of the PCB should overhang the socket.



## Manufacturing

The release includes the manufacturing files for JLCPCB specifically. If you need to the gerber files, BOM or component pick & place in a different format then you would have to generate them yourself.

The PCB thickness chosen should be as thin as possible. I've used 0.8mm PCBs and it was ok on a Mac SE socket.
